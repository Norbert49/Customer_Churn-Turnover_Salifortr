# Customer_Churn-Turnover_Salifortr

##Project Overview
This project addresses the high turnover rate among Salifort Motors employees. Using survey data, the analysis aims to predict employee departure and uncover the underlying reasons. The goal is to enhance retention, job satisfaction, and reduce the financial impact of recruitment and training costs. The modeling approach involves leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict turnover based on key factors such as job title, department, number of projects, and average monthly hours.

##Business Understanding:
Salifort Motors faces a significant challenge with a high employee turnover rate, impacting both financial resources and the company's commitment to fostering a supportive corporate culture. The leadership team is concerned about the cost implications and aims to predict and understand employee departures. This proactive approach aligns with Salifort's goal of creating a culture that supports employee success and development.

##Data Understanding:
The analysis utilizes survey data from Salifort Motors employees, encompassing variables such as satisfaction level, last evaluation score, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent with the company, work accidents, promotions in the last 5 years, department, and salary. The timeframe of the data and any limitations are outlined to provide context. Exploratory data analysis visualizations may be included to illustrate key insights.

##Modeling and Evaluation:
The modeling approach involves building predictive models, potentially using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and XGBoost. Evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, will be used to assess model performance. The choice of models will be guided by their effectiveness in predicting employee turnover.

##Conclusion:
The analysis aims to provide insights into the key factors driving employee turnover, allowing for informed decision-making. Recommendations for enhancing retention and job satisfaction will be presented to the leadership team. Future steps may involve continuous monitoring of turnover metrics and refining the model to adapt to changing organizational dynamics. The project serves as a foundation for ongoing efforts to create a more stable and supportive work environment at Salifort Motors.
